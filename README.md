# Rice CyberSecurity FinalProject
Offensive, Defensive and Mitigation Strategies

## The objective was to practice a number of different concepts learned throughout the cybersecurity bootcamp course and to act as a pentester and SOC analyst. 

- Find vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress server.

- Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher

- Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious activity on the network traffic

Note: The presentation was created as a group with classmates. However, all other documentation for offensive, defensive and network analysis was my own personal work. We were only assigned to be a team to bring our findings together on the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
